# It's Ready - Project Notes

## Important URLs and Resources

- Frontend Production URL: https://its-ready-dxg3nm589-nuworld-agency.vercel.app

## Implementation Notes

- The frontend connects to the analysis API for food freshness detection
- Images are converted to base64 in the browser before sending to the API
- The application is deployed and hosted on Vercel
- The API workflow receives the image and returns the analysis results
- Toast notifications provide user feedback during the analysis process

## Technical Considerations

- Image size and format limitations are implemented in the frontend
- Error handling accounts for API issues and incomplete responses
- Response format parsing is handled in the frontend API client
- The API response format follows the structure:

  ```json
  {
    "output": {
      "identifiedFood": "Raw Steak",
      "visualAssessment": "Very Fresh",
      "keyIndicators": "Meat shows bright red color...",
      "estimatedFreshnessDays": "3-5",
      "confidence": "High",
      "importantDisclaimer": "DISCLAIMER: This assessment..."
    }
  }
  ```

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication for personalized history
- Implement offline functionality for common food items
- Add image storage and history viewing
- Implement food freshness tracking over time
- Create a mobile app version
